# QDmrconfig

## Description
Qt Frontend to https://github.com/sergev/dmrconfig

Basically a glorified configuration file editor. Only really used and tested
with a BTECH DMR 6x2

## Filtering
Filtering is possible thanks to regex. Filter any column by regex string if
needed. This is handy when you want to find certain scanlists or zones

## Field Injection
Freely inject or remove values from fields by cell or by batch selection
